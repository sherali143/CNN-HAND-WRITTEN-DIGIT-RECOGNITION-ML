# CNN-HAND-WRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-ML

# Python MNIST Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Additionally, it extends its capabilities to detect handwritten digits created in paint applications and images extracted from videos.

## Features

- **MNIST Dataset Recognition**: Accurately recognizes handwritten digits from the standard MNIST dataset (digits 0 to 9).
  
- **Paint Application Detection**: Capable of detecting and recognizing handwritten digits created in paint applications, providing flexibility beyond pre-existing datasets.

- **Video Image Recognition**: Utilizes computer vision techniques to extract frames from videos and identify handwritten digits within the frames, enabling real-time digit recognition from video streams.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning)
- MNIST dataset

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**: Train the CNN model using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
   
2. **Paint Application Integration**: Implement functionality to detect and recognize handwritten digits created in paint applications.

3. **Video Processing**: Utilize OpenCV to extract frames from videos and apply digit recognition algorithms to identify handwritten digits within the frames.
